Lets now turn our focus to binary classification using a simple classification algorithm known as Logistic regression.\n","\n","In linear regression we tried to predict the value of $y$ for an example $\\mathbf{x}$ using a linear function $y=\\mathbf{x}^\\top\\theta$ (where $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\theta$ are column-vectors). This will clearly not be a great solution for predicting binary-valued labels ($y\\in\\{0,1\\}$). In logistic regression we use a different hypothesis class to try to predict the probability that a given example belongs to the \"1\" class versus the probability that it belongs to the \"0\" class. Specifically, we will try to learn a function of the form:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","P(y=1|\\mathbf{x}) &= \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\mathbf{x}^\\top\\theta)} \\equiv \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}^\\top\\theta),\\\\\n","P(y=0|\\mathbf{x}) &= 1 - P(y=1|\\mathbf{x}).\n","\\end{align}\n"," \n","The function $\\sigma(z) \\equiv \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z)}$ is called the \"sigmoid\" or \"logistic\" function. The sigmoid function squashes any real valued input into the range $[0,1]$ enabling us to interprete the output as a probability. Our goal is to search for a value of $\\theta$ so that the probability $P(y=1|\\mathbf{x})=\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}^\\top\\theta)$ is large when $\\mathbf{x}$ belongs to the \"1\" class and small when $\\mathbf{x}$ belongs to the \"0\" class (so that $P(y=0|\\mathbf{x})$ is large). \n","\n","With Linear Regression, the natural cost function was one that measured the sum of squared residuals (the difference between the predicted value and true value). With logisitic regression we have a probabilisitic model, so it makes sense that we use a function that measures the likelihood of the data given the model (note that we want to maximise this function rather than minimise it). As an aside, note that in the case of linear regression if we assume that the data has errors that are IID (independently and identically distributed) according to a Normal distribution, then it can be shown that the maximising the likelihood is exactly the same as minimising the sum of squared residuals. For logistic regression, the likelihood function for a single data point is:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","p(y|\\mathbf{x}; \\theta) &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}^\\top\\theta)^y(1-\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}^\\top\\theta)^{(1-y)}.\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","For a complete dataset of points $(y_i, \\mathbf{x}_i)$, then the complete likelihood is:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","L(\\theta) &= \\prod_i \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top\\theta)^{y_i}(1-\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top\\theta)^{(1-y_i)}\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","However, it is considerably easier to maximise the log-likelihood function:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\mathcal{l}(\\theta) &= \\log L(\\theta) \\\\\n","                    & = \\log \\prod_i \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top\\theta)^{y_i}(1-\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top\\theta)^{(1-y_i)} \\\\\n","                    & = \\sum_i y_i \\log(\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top\\theta)) + (1-y_i) \\log(1-\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top\\theta))\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","Clearly, maximising the log-likelihood is equivalent to minimising the negative log-likelihood.

Sometimes a subtly buggy implementation will manage to learn something that can look surprisingly reasonable (while performing less well than a correct implementation). Thus, even with a buggy implementation, it may not at all be apparent that anything is amiss. In this section, we describe a method for numerically checking the derivatives computed by your code to make sure that your implementation is correct.
