A rectifier linear unit (ReLU) activation function is used for the neurons in the hidden layer. Note how we use the PyTorch 'Functional API' for stateless operations like applying the ReLU; we could construct a `torch.nn.ReLU` in the constructor and save it in an instance variable instead, but ultimately this would lead to more lines of code.\n","\n","The `nn.Module` class defines a instance variable called `training` that is set to `True` when the model is being trained and `False` when it is being evaluated after being trained. In our model definition we've used a softmax activation function on the output layer to turn the outputs into probability-like values, but have only set this to be enabled when we are not training the model. We've done this because we will use PyTorch's implementation of Cross Entropy Loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`) during training which implicitly adds a softmax before a logarithmic loss (technically it adds a log-softmax activation followed by a negative log-likelihood loss as this has much better numerical properties). If you've used a library like Keras before you should note that this approach is different to the one taken there - Keras expects you to explicitly add a `Softmax` layer to use with its `categorical_crossentropy` loss.\n","\n","In our case the softmax isn't actually necessary for model evaluation if we're only interested in the most likely class; the _logits_ (unscaled log probabilities) provided by the final fully connected layer before the softmax can be used directly as the largest logit will correspond to the most likely class.\n","\n","## Training and Evaluating the Model\n","We can now fit and evaluate the model. One of the design decisions of PyTorch is that everything should be explicit so we have full control over our models and the training process. This means that we actually need to write the model training loop by hand, and perform each of the various operations (perform the forward-pass, compute the loss, perform the backward-pass, and update the weights). In the code below we'll fit the model to the data over 10 epochs using batches of 128 images provided by the `DataLoader` defined previously. We'll make use of the ADAM optimiser as it broadly tends to work well practically despite its limitations. Running the code below should take just a couple of minutes to complete the training."]},{"metadata":{"id":"_n_bQSeWj2rD","colab_type":"code","outputId":"061453b4-d675-42a1-c699-c4dd043fea2f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1552862299394,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":261773,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro ALonso Canales","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jV8WXecss1w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANE/32JjbscTH8U/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"12793804458084108361"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":386}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# build the model \n","model = BaselineModel(784, 784, 10)\n","\n","# define the loss function and the optimiser\n","loss_function = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n","optimiser = optim.Adam(model.parameters())\n","\n","# the epoch loop\n","for epoch in range(10):\n","    running_loss = 0.0\n","    for data in trainloader:\n","        # get the inputs\n","        inputs, labels = data\n","\n","        # zero the parameter gradients\n","        optimiser.zero_grad()\n","\n","        # forward + loss + backward + optimise (update weights)\n","        outputs = model(inputs)\n","        loss = loss_function(outputs, labels)\n","        loss.backward()\n","        optimiser.step()\n","\n","        # keep track of the loss this epoch\n","        running_loss += loss.item()\n","    print(\"Epoch %d, loss %4.2f\" % (epoch, running_loss))\n","print('**** Finished Training ****')"],"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Epoch 0, loss 134.52\n","Epoch 1, loss 52.32\n","Epoch 2, loss 33.47\n","Epoch 3, loss 23.82\n","Epoch 4, loss 17.42\n","Epoch 5, loss 13.08\n","Epoch 6, loss 9.26\n","Epoch 7, loss 7.15\n","Epoch 8, loss 6.05\n","Epoch 9, loss 4.10\n","**** Finished Training ****\n","Epoch 0, loss 134.52\n","Epoch 1, loss 52.32\n","Epoch 2, loss 33.47\n","Epoch 3, loss 23.82\n","Epoch 4, loss 17.42\n","Epoch 5, loss 13.08\n","Epoch 6, loss 9.26\n","Epoch 7, loss 7.15\n","Epoch 8, loss 6.05\n","Epoch 9, loss 4.10\n","**** Finished Training ****\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"checksum":"2462a62df8582d5597cae7ea8b0a4b79","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-bc1ac2c5ef9f4cc8","locked":true,"schema_version":1,"solution":false},"id":"hQXIJGmuj2rF","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In the above we added a crude indicator of progress by printing the total loss at the end of each epoch.
