The one-hot encoded vector is a *sparse vector*, whilst the real valued vector is a *dense vector*. \n","\n","The key concept in these word embeddings is that words that appear in similar _contexts_ appear nearby in the vector space, i.e. the Euclidean distance between these two word vectors is small. By context here, we mean the surrounding words. For example in the sentences \"I purchased some items at the shop\" and \"I purchased some items at the store\" the words 'shop' and 'store' appear in the same context and thus should be close together in vector space.\n","\n","We'll talk about some of the well-known algorithms for learning embeddings in the lectures, but you might have already heard of a popular model called *word2vec*, which was first published in a rejected ICLR submission (it has some pretty damning reviews, but also has thousands of citations!). In this lab we'll use pre-trained *GloVe* vectors. *GloVe* is a different algorithm for computing word vectors, although the outcome is similar to *word2vec*. These pre-trained embeddings have been trained on a gigantic corpus. We can use these pre-trained vectors within any of our models, with the idea that as they have already learned the context of each word they will give us a better starting point for our word vectors. This usually leads to faster training time and/or improved accuracy.\n","\n","In PyTorch, we use word vectors with the `nn.Embedding` layer, which takes a _**[sentence length, batch size]**_ tensor and transforms it into a _**[sentence length, batch size, embedding dimensions]**_ tensor. `nn.Embedding` layers can be trained from scratch, or they can be initialised (and optionally fixed) with pre-trained embedding data. The key thing to remember about an `nn.Embedding` is that it does not need to explicitly use a one-hot vector representation at any point; it just maps an index to a vector. This is important because it implies massive computational savings; more concretly an Emdedding is essentially a linear map in which the weight matrix of the linear layer is multiplied by a one-hot sparse-vector to produce a lower-dimensional (dense) output. This is exactly equivalent to just selecting the column of the weight matrix corresponding to the index represented by the sparse vector.\n","\n","In this part of the lab we won't be training any models; instead we'll be looking at the word embeddings and investigating a few interesting things we can do with them.\n","\n","## Loading the GloVe vectors\n","\n","First, we'll load the pre-trained GloVe vectors. The `name` field specifies what the vectors have been trained on, here the `6B` means a corpus of 6 billion words. The `dim` argument specifies the dimensionality of the word vectors. GloVe vectors are available in 50, 100, 200 and 300 dimensions. There is also a `42B` and `840B` glove vectors, however they are only available at 300 dimensions.
